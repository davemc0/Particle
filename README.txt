Particle System API

version 2.0

This distribution contains three source trees. Here is an explanation of each:

Particle2:  The Particle System API
            The Particle2 library is released under the Gnu GPL.

Goodies:    DLLs and other libs I use, like GLUT, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, Half, etc.
            The code in Goodies is probably copyright by its authors.

DMcTools:   This has my collection of graphics tools - VRML loader, image stuff,
            vector class, random number generator stop watch, matrix class, etc.
	    It is only needed by the PSpray demo, not the API or the Example demo.
            DMcTools is copyright by me, and maybe others.

If you have any questions, contributions or suggestions you can mail me at davemc@cs.unc.edu. [I work for Nvidia now, but don't want my Nvidia email address posted where spambots can find it.]
