This distribution contains three source trees. Here is an explanation of each:

Particle2:  The Particle System API
            The Particle2 library is released under the GNU LGPL.

Goodies:    Libs I use on Windows, like GLUT, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, Half, etc.
            The code in Goodies is probably copyright by its authors.

DMcTools:   This has my collection of graphics tools - matrix class, image stuff,
            3D vector class, random numbers, stop watch, VRML loader, etc.
            It is only needed by the PSpray and ParBench demo, not the API or the Example demo.
            DMcTools is copyright by me, and maybe others.

If the demo doesn't work for you, I'd be happy to try to help. Please include as much detail as
you can about your system and the nature of the problem.

If you have any questions, code contributions or suggestions you can mail me at davemc@cs.unc.edu.
I work for Nvidia now, but don't want my Nvidia email address posted where spambots can find it.
