    <title>ParticleAPI: To Do</title>

    <h1>
        To Do</h1>
    <p>
        If anyone would like to do one of these, go for it! I might get to them eventually.</p>
    <h2>
        API</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use Nvidia's CUDA library to do the particle computation on the GPU</li>
        <li>Bouncing off multiple nearby or intersecting domains is broken (see Waterfall).</li>
        <li>Bounce off inside PDBox domain</li>
        <li>Make the API more generic so many API calls can apply to any different attribute.
            Make attributes generic.</li>
        <li>Use SSE better. Requires a new four-element pVec class. I implemented this and rewrote
            the Move() action in SSE. The inner loop came out to 8 instructions. However, the
            code is ugly and I had trouble getting the alignment of particles in STL vectors
            to obey the alignment constraint of SSE.</li>
        <li>Optimize compiled action lists by combining calls: fountain 17.21 fps optimized
            vs. 5.1 fps not.</li>
        <li>Make actions conditional on domains.</li>
        <li>Compound domains (so you can define a whole model as a single domain instead of
            a zillion triangle domains). This may be the answer for obstacle avoidance.</li>
        <li>Have a secondary color for each particle.</li>
        <li>DensityColor - color is f(density)</li>
        <li>PositionColor - color is f(position)</li>
        <li>RandomColor - random domain is added to color</li>
        <li>VelocityColor - color is f(velocity)</li>
        <li>VelocitySize - size is f(velocity)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Demos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Environment reflected water drops</li>
        <li>Make demos that use a wider variety of actions</li>
        <li>Demo where you put particles all over the surface of a statue, explode the statue,
            and then suck the particles back to the original position.</li>
        <li>Toggle creation/killing of particles for all effects so the Snake doesn't kill them,
            etc.</li>
        <li>Make an actual Windows screensaver.</li>
        <li>Integrate Boids into Effects.cpp.</li>
    </ul>
