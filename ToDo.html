    <h1>
        To Do</h1>
    <p>
        If anyone would like to do one of these, go for it! I might get to them eventually.</p>
    <h2>API</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix memory leaks. See Sphere demo. But not Atom.
        <li>Benchmark update
        <li>Back port _Impl functions to original actions
        <li>Optimize compiled action lists by combining calls. I believe the CUDA implementation will handle this.
        <li>Bouncing off multiple nearby or intersecting domains is broken (see Waterfall).
        <li>Bouncing and avoiding of PDUnion domains. This may be the answer for obstacle avoidance.
        <li>Bounce off cylinders
        <li>Way points - like OrbitPoint, but once a particle is close enough, it is attracted to the next way point
        <li>Bitmapped vector fields
        <li>Particle-particle collisions
        <li>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
        <li>Make actions conditional on domains.
        <li>Make the API more generic so many API calls can apply to any different attribute. Make attributes generic.
        <li>Have a secondary color for each particle.
        <li>DensityColor - color is f(density)
        <li>PositionColor - color is f(position)
        <li>RandomColor - random domain is added to color
        <li>VelocityColor - color is f(velocity)
        <li>VelocitySize - size is f(velocity)
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Demos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Steer plane is broken
        <li> Bounce sphere outside is broken
        <li> Per-effect rendering options: motion blur, primitive, texture, depth test, particle size; Do I just make an init function, or do I make a struct?
        <li> Fix motion blur
        <li> Smiley face image restore default
        <li> Fix crash bug
        <li> par unseq
        <li> Add resiliency cutoff so it bounces 100% if below cutoff and clean up friction
        <li> Force inside / outside a 3D domain
        <li> Constraints
        <li> Verlet integration
        <li> Fireworks that explode
        <li> Image pixels to color cube and vice-versa
        <li> User interaction
        <li> Texture and light the butterflies
        <li> Change pVec to not do x(),y(),z()
        <li> Get Boids working

        <li>Environment reflected water drops
        <li>Make demos that use a wider variety of actions
        <li>Demo where you put particles all over the surface of a statue, explode the statue, and then suck the particles back to the original position.
        <li>Integrate Boids into Playground / Effects.cpp
    </ul>
