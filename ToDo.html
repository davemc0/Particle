    <h1>
        To Do</h1>
    <p>
        If anyone would like to do one of these, go for it! I might get to them eventually.</p>
    <h2>API</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make Source and Vertex work in inline mode
        <li>Bouncing off multiple nearby or intersecting domains is broken (see Waterfall). Solve with constraints.     
        <li>Bouncing and avoiding of PDUnion domains.
        <li>Bounce off cylinders
        <li>Way points - like OrbitPoint, but once a particle is close enough, it is attracted to the next way point
        <li>Voxelized vector fields
        <li>Particle-particle collisions
        <li>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
        <li>Make actions conditional on domains. Let Jet, but generalized.
        <li>Make the API more generic so many API calls can apply to any different attribute. Make attributes generic.
        <li>Have a secondary color for each particle.
        <li>DensityColor - color is f(density)
        <li>PositionColor - color is f(position)
        <li>RandomColor - random domain is added to color
        <li>VelocityColor - color is f(velocity)
        <li>VelocitySize - size is f(velocity)
        <li>Organize particle groups as structures of arrays instead of arrays of structures for stream processing
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Demos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix fireworks to use inline actions
        <li>Get rid of KillOld so all the particles don't just disappear when changing demos
        <li>Smiley face image restore default
        <li>Add resiliency cutoff so it bounces 100% if below cutoff and clean up friction
        <li>Force inside / outside a 3D domain
        <li>Constraints
        <li>Verlet integration
        <li>Fireworks that explode
        <li>Image pixels to color cube and vice-versa
        <li>User interaction
        <li>Texture and light the butterflies
        <li>Change pVec to not do x(),y(),z()
        <li>Environment reflected water drops
        <li>Make demos that use a wider variety of actions
        <li>Demo where you put particles all over the surface of a statue, explode the statue, and then suck the particles back to the original position.
    </ul>
