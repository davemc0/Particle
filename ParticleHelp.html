        and other new developments.</p>
    <h1>
        Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The Particle System Application Programmer Interface (API) is a set of functions
        that allow C++ programs to simulate the dynamics of particles. The Particle System
        API is intended for special effects in interactive and non-interactive graphics
        applications, not for scientific simulation, although principles of Newtonian physics
        have been used to implement the particle dynamics where applicable.</p>
    <p>
        The API consists of four sets of functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Particle Group Calls</b> - A particle group is a system of particles that are
            all acted on together. It can be considered a dynamic geometric object. From the
            point of view of the graphics system, a particle group is just another model to
            be drawn. These calls create and destroy particle groups, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Source State Calls</b> - As in OpenGL, some calls actually do something and some
            calls modify the behavior of the subsequent calls that do something. The source
            state setting calls set the attributes of particles that will be created with the
            Source or Vertex calls. The source state calls are in the PContextSourceState_t
            part of the PContextState_t structure.</li>
        <li><b>Actions</b> implement the particle dynamics. Bounce and Gravity are examples
            of actions.</li>
        <li><b>Action List Calls</b> create and operate on lists of actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Following are several basic concepts central to the Particle System API.</p>
    <h2>
        Particles</h2>
    <p>
        For the purposes of the Particle System API, a particle is not just a very tiny
        speck. Particles can be drawn as anything - water droplets, birds, tumbleweeds,
        boulders, etc.. The Particle System API is generally useful for operating on many
        similar objects that all move and change according to the same basic rules, no matter
        what the objects and rules are.</p>
    <p>
        A particle in the abstract sense used by the API is merely an entity with a small
        set of attributes such as position and color that ultimately dictate the particle's
        behavior and appearance. Here are the particle attributes:</p>

    <h2>
        Actions</h2>
    <p>
        Actions are the core of the Particle System API. They are the functions in the API
        that directly manipulate particles in particle groups. They perform effects such
        as gravity, explosions, bouncing, etc. to all particles in the current particle
        group. A program typically creates and initializes one or more particle groups,
        then during each frame it calls particle actions to animate the particles then gets
        the particle data and draws the group of particles onto the screen.</p>
    <p>
        The Particle System API uses a discrete time approximation to all actions. See TimeStep
        for information on improving simulation quality by varying the time step, <i>dt</i>.</p>
    <h2>
        Action Lists</h2>
    <p>
        Action lists are blocks of actions that are applied together to a particle group.
        An action list is conceptually similar to a script or procedure. Action lists are
        implemented and expressed similarly to display lists in OpenGL. An action list encapsulates
        the specifics of a particular effect and allows complex effects to be treated as
        primitives like actions. An action list can be called from within another action
        list.</p>
    <p>
        Action lists also allow effects to be simulated much more efficiently because the
        entire set of actions is known at the start, and this knowledge can be used by the
        implementation of the Particle System API. For example, several actions can be applied
        to one set of particles before moving to the next set of particles, yielding better
        memory access patterns. Also, in future versions common sequences of actions might
        be detected and replaced by efficient code that handles all those actions in one
        pass.
    </p>
    <p>
        To take advantage of the up to 50% performance increase of action lists, you need
        to order your actions carefully. The performance advantage is achieved when two
        or more actions that can be combined are ordered next to each other in the list.
        Actions that create or delete particles (Vertex(), Source(), Sink*(), and Kill*())
        and actions that reorder particles (Sort()) cannot be combined. All other actions
        can be combined to yield the performance advantage. See Effects.cpp for several
        examples of efficient ordering.</p>
    <h2>
        Domains</h2>
    <p>
        A Domain is a representation of a region of 3D space. For example, the Source action
        uses a domain to describe the volume in which a particle's random initial position
        will be. The Avoid(), Sink() and Bounce() actions use domains to describe a volume
        in space for particles to steer to avoid, die when they enter, or to bounce off,
        respectively. Domains are used as parameters to many functions within the API. See
        <a href="ParticleLib/doc/html/class_p_a_p_i_1_1p_domain.html">the Domains section of
            this documentation</a> for more.</p>
    <h2>
        Default Parameters</h2>
    <p>
        Many functions in the Particle System API take arguments with default values. This
        is a feature of C++. For example, in <code>Color(float r, float g, float b, float alpha
            = 1.0f)</code>, the parameter alpha has a default value of 1.0. This means that
        Color can be called with either three parameters or four. When called with three
        parameters, they are the values of r, g, and b; and alpha receives the default value,
        1.0. Only parameters at the end of the parameter list can have default values. Likewise,
        when calling functions that have default values for parameters, all values specified
        will be applied to parameters starting with the left. This means that there is no
        way to specify a value for a parameter at the end of the list without specifying
        values for all parameters to its left.</p>

    <h2>
        Source State Setting Calls</h2>
    <p>
        These calls dictate the properties of particles to be created by Source or Vertex.
        When particles are created within a NewActionList / EndActionList block, they will
        receive attributes from the state that was current when the action list was created.
        When in immediate mode (not creating or calling an action list), particles are created
        with attributes from the current state.</p>

            of Source State Setting Calls</a></p>
    <h2>
        Actions</h2>
    <p>
        Actions modify the position, color, velocity, size, age, and other attributes of
        particles. All actions apply to the current particle group, as set by CurrentGroup.
        Some actions will add particles to or delete them from the particle group, and others
        will modify the particles in other ways. Typically, a series of actions will be
        applied to each particle group once (or more) per rendered frame.</p>
    <p>
        Remember that the amount of effect of an action call depends on the time step size,
        dt, as set by TimeStep. See <a href="ParticleLib/doc/html/class_p_a_p_i_1_1_p_context_action_list__t.html#9fa136fd186410e43b03803942240669">
            TimeStep</a> for an explanation of time steps.</p>
    <p>
        Some functions have parameters with a default value of P_EPS. P_EPS is a very small
        floating point constant that is most often used as the default value of the epsilon
        parameter to actions whose influence on a particle is relative to the inverse square
        of its distance from something. If that distance is very small, the amount of influence
        approaches infinity. Since all actions are computed using Euler's method, this can
        cause unsatisfying results in which particles are accelerated way too much. So this
        epsilon parameter is added to the distance before taking its inverse square, thus
        keeping the acceleration within reasonable limits. By varying epsilon, you specify
        what is reasonable. Larger epsilon make particles accelerate less.</p>

    <h2>
        Particle Group Calls</h2>
    <p>
        A particle group is first created using GenParticleGroups, which will create a sequentially-numbered
        set of particle groups and return the identifying number of the first generated
        particle group. You specify which group is current using CurrentGroup. Unless otherwise
        stated, all other commands operate on the current particle group. The maximum number
        of particles in the group is specified using SetMaxParticles. The particle group
        is then acted upon using the <a href="ParticleLib/doc/html/class_p_a_p_i_1_1_p_context_actions__t.html">
            Actions</a>.</p>
    <p>
        After the actions have been applied, the particles are rendered. This is done at
        the same stage of the application's execution as drawing other geometry. To draw
        a particle group in OpenGL, the application calls GetParticles or GetParticlePointer
        functions to get the vertex data, then sends it to OpenGL. When a particle group
        is no longer needed, it is deleted using DeleteParticleGroups.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="ParticleLib/doc/html/class_p_a_p_i_1_1_p_context_particle_group__t.html">List
            of Particle Group Calls</a></p>
    <h2>
        Action List Calls</h2>
    <p>
        These calls create and operate on action lists, which are scripts of many actions
        to be applied together as a block to the current particle group. An empty action
        list is first created using GenActionLists, and is then filled or compiled by calling
        NewActionList, then calling Actions, then calling EndActionList. Once the action
        list is filled, it is run via CallActionList. Thus, an action list is sort of a
        higher-level action. Complex behaviors can be stored in an action list and then
        called later, even as part of another action list. Action lists cannot be edited.
        They can only be created or destroyed. To destroy an action list, call DeleteActionLists.
        When particles are created within a NewActionList / EndActionList block, they will
        receive attributes from the state that was current when the action list was created.</p>
    <p>
        When in immediate mode (not creating or calling an action list), particles are created
        with attributes from the current state. However, the time step length, dt, uses
        the value that is current when CallActionList is executed, not the value of dt when
        the action list was created. This allows dt to be modified without recompiling action
        lists. Maybe this isn't a good idea. If it should be the other way in the future,
        let me know.</p>
