    <h1>
        Version 2.10 Changes (November 2006)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Documented the API using Doxygen. I'm new to Doxygen, so feel free to change things
            or give me advice. But finally the API documentation is current.</li>
        <li>Updated my Makefiles and compiled the code on Linux under GCC 4.1.</li>
        <li>Changed the Visual Studio project files to be Visual Studio 2005 (VC8). With VC8's
            stricter containers, I fixed a few pseudo-bugs.</li>
        <li>Implemented C++ exception handling for error detection and reporting.</li>
        <li>Created a PAPI namespace and put the whole API in it. My demos use "using namespace
            PAPI;", but you can put "PAPI::" in front of every identifier if you feel the need.</li>
        <li>Created a user-visible ParticleContext_t struct. It contains four base classes,
            each of which contains one of the four kinds of API calls. Most people will probably
            create a single, global ParticleContext_t in their app. For example,
            <pre>
ParticleContext_t P;

void DoParticles()
{
    P.Color(pVec(1,1,1));
    P.Source(10, PDLine(pVec(0.0, 0.0, 0.401), pVec(0.0, 0.0, 0.405)));
    P.Move();
}
</pre>
            For single-threaded apps, the main change is that you say <code>P.Action()</code>
            rather than <code>pAction()</code>. This new structure is more thread-safe, more
            C++-esque and better performing when multithreaded.</li>
        <li>Renamed ColorD() to Color() and *D() because the function prototype distinguishes
            the version.</li>
        <li>Added a ResetSourceState() call that sets the particle creation state back to its
            default values.</li>
        <li>Changed SetMaxParticles() to not return a value because it was just the value that
            you passed in.</li>
        <li>Removed the Reset() function that deletes all the particles in the current group
            because SetMaxParticles(0) will do that.</li>
        <li>Changed the default value of StartingAge's sigma from 1.0 to 0.0. I figure that
            if people don't specify an amount of variation in the starting age, it's probably
            because they don't want any.</li>
        <li>Finally got a good Vortex action defined. It's beautiful!</li>
        <li>Optimized the code further. Performance is up by a factor of 2 or 3 in many cases.</li>
        <li>I tuned the working set size for action lists down to 256KB. This apparently gives
            us all the goodness, and works on every machine. Added a SetWorkingSetSize() command.</li>
        <li>Using action lists is now <i>very</i> beneficial. I changed PSpray to make this
            the default.</li>
        <li>Added flags to the Move() action to specify whether you're moving the velocity,
            rotational velocity, or both.</li>
        <li>Changed the semantics of the Restore() and Explosion() actions so that you now have
            to decrement time_left, or increment radius manually, even in action list mode.
            This is to preserve the rule that action lists don't change once created.</li>
        <li>Cleaned up the code internally, mostly in regards to STL containers that have changed
            with the compiler upgrades.</li>
        <li>Renamed some of the .cpp files to have more clear names.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where mass was not properly getting changed in some cases.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where particle age was not receiving a normal distribution for particles
            made with Vertex().</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        Version 2.0 Beta Changes (March 2006)</h1>
    <p>
        This is the first major update to the particle system API in about five years. It
        includes enhancements in several areas. Here are the major improvements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More actions. I added pSort, which sorts particles back-to-front, given an eye point
            and look vector. I added control over the random number seeds (useful for repeatability
            and multithreaded apps). Someone (I wish I could remember who) added support for
            callback functions that get called whenever a particle is created or destroyed.
            He also added particle rotation actions. This is really nice for complex particles
            like boulders.</li>
        <li>Improved actions. The pJet action can now apply acceleration to particles within
            any domain, not just within a sphere. Particles can now bounce off the inside of
            a sphere domain. The vortex action is more sane now.</li>
        <li>Stronger typing. Each API call used to just take a long list of floats as args.
            This was confusing, especially for specifying domains. Now the vector type, pVec,
            and the domains are exposed as classes, so this line:
            <pre>
pSource(10, PDLine, 0.0, 0.0, 0.401, 0.0, 0.0, 0.405);
</pre>
            becomes this:
            <pre>
pSource(10, PDLine(pVec(0.0, 0.0, 0.401), pVec(0.0, 0.0, 0.405)));
</pre>
            This is much easier to read, safer, and now the Visual C++ editor can provide useful
            function prototype hints.</li>
        <li>Faster code. It is now very advantageous to use action lists. This is because I
            divide a particle group into working sets that are about the size of a CPU's L2
            cache. I perform as many actions as possible on this working set before moving on
            to the next. That way, the particles only get loaded into cache on the first action
            of their working set, rather than for every action. This provides about a 2X speedup
            for large particle systems. I have also experimented with compound actions, which
            are hard-coded combinations of actions, such as "pSink(); pMove();". When these
            two appear in an action list, an internal action, pSinkMove, could be called instead
            to further reduce overhead. A compound Fountain action got about a 3X speedup over
            the traditional fountain. I have also experimented with using SSE, and have made
            some infrastructure changes to prepare, but haven't done the actual implementation
            yet. I have turned on /arch:SSE2 in the MSVC compiler and got about 15% speedup
            from it. I also improved the efficiency of several individual actions such as pRestore.</li>
        <li>Better code. I have used STL containers to re-implement action lists and particle
            groups, thereby fixing some bugs and making the code more readable. I made each
            kind of domain a separate class and use virtual functions instead of switch statements.
            It's just as fast and is much more solid and more extensible. I also reorganized
            classes and pulled all global variables into classes.</li>
        <li>Better demos. I have restructured the demos for better code sharing, and made it
            easier to add new effects. I spruced up some effects, and added new ones: a snow
            globe, a bunch of rectangles that the particles bounce off, and a flame thrower.
            It now cycles randomly through the demos like a screen saver.</li>
        <li>I added a point sprite rendering mode to the demos. Point sprites allow an arbitrary
            texture to be mapped onto a screen-aligned square primitive. This square is defined
            by a single GL vertex. This is several times faster than the old way of creating
            screen-aligned textured primitives, which required three or four vertices.</li>
        <li>I removed the pDrawGroup* calls. It's pretty rare that they provide exactly what
            you want, and they created a dependency on OpenGL. Instead, look at the code in
            Example.cpp and DrawGroups.cpp to see ways of drawing with OpenGL.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        Version 1.2 Changes (November 1999)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added a gaussian splat drawing mode to PSpray. You can draw either as a triangle
            or a quad with a gaussian alpha texture.</li>
        <li>Added a PDDisc domain for generating and bouncing.</li>
        <li>Split the PDPlane domain into PDPlane, for infinite planes and half-spaces; and
            PDRectangle, for rhombus-shaped planar patches.</li>
        <li>Added pTargetVelocity to make all particles tend toward a given velocity. This is
            a component of Boids.</li>
        <li>Added pMatchVelocity to match velocity to near neighbors.</li>
        <li>Added pAvoid to steer to avoid the given domain.</li>
        <li>Added pSpeedLimit.</li>
        <li>Removed pKillSlow. Instead use pSinkVelocity.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in the Within logic for PDBlob so now it's right.</li>
        <li>Demonstrated flocking behavior using a Boids demo.</li>
        <li>Changed pGetParticles so that verts can be NULL. It now returns the number of particles
            it's copying. This way you can just tell it the size of your array instead of having
            to call pGetGroupCount.</li>
        <li>Changed the particle size scalar to be a domain. This will allow greater expression
            of particle shape. Orientation becomes more important. Added pSizeD to specify it.
            Changed pGetParticles so that it returns three floats per particle for size.</li>
        <li>For Windows, made it a DLL instead of a static library.</li>
        <li>For Windows, ships with a DLL compiled with the Intel Vtune compiler (a bit faster).</li>
        <li>Made pspray choose a demo randomly on startup.</li>
        <li>Made pStartingAge take an optional parameter for the standard deviation of random
            starting ages, centered at age.</li>
        <li>Replaced the lifetime parameter of explosions with stdev and made the shock wave
            be gaussian instead of square. This will fix the ugly stratification effects in
            explosions of very dense particle clouds.</li>
        <li>Updated the documentation.</li>
        <li>Changed pCallActionList to be storable in action lists, as the docs said.</li>
        <li>Added a trivial app. for learning the API.</li>
        <li>Made a rocket demo. It has the rockets in one particle group and their sparks in
            another, generated at the rocket positions.</li>
        <li>When re-using an action list that was already generated, it now properly deletes
            the previous actions.</li>
    </ul>
